## Allowed Mods

Comfy Valheim is vanilla-friendly, so feel free to play without any mods at all. 
However, the following mods are here to enhance your experience if you choose to install them. You do not have to install every mod, just the ones you'd like. 
Only mods on the approved mods list may be used on Comfy Valheim, per the 📌-rules.

This is largely to make sure that mods do not break the game for everyone else, to keep balance fair, and to allow modless players to still be able to play.

## Comfy Modpack

The easiest way to install mods is with the Comfy Modpack with the Thunderstore Mod Manager. It includes all of our most commonly used mods and you'll automatically get an update when we approve new mods we think most people will use. Also adds a button to your start screen so you can quickly connect to Comfy Valheim without having to type the address every time. The Comfy Modpack gives you a great "basic mod kit" but you can add other mods as long as they're on the approved Mod List in the next section. Thunderstore will also automatically update your mods for you so you get bug fixes, less lag, and new features. You can see which mods are included on the Comfy modpack page itself.

Easy Mod Setup with the Comfy Valheim Modpack
1. Download Thunderstore Mod Manager 
2. Go to Valheim and "Select Game"
3. Click the button "Create new" to create a profile and name it "Comfy Valheim Hearth"
4. Press "Select Profile"
5. Go to this page and click "Install with Mod Manager" https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/ComfyMods/ComfyValheimPack/ 
6. Go to "Installed" and if there is a yellow bar that tells you that you need updates hit "update all". You'll almost always just want to click this if you see it to get latest bug fixes and features.
6.5 ( Most people will also want the "Gizmo" mod. You can go to "Online" and search for it. It's not included in the pack because some builders prefer other tools but it's the most common one to let you rotate items in other directions.)
7. Start the Game From Thunderstore. Click "Start Modded" and Valheim will start!
7.5. You may notice your hair changes color, this is because of the mod DyeHard. Press F1 and you can Disable it or change the color to what you'd like. 

## Mod List

The Comfy Modpack includes our most commonly used mods, but we have a longer list of approved mods that not everyone will use. (Such as VR or custom textures). 
The recommended method for Mod Installation is by using the Thunderstore Mod Manager

Denied & Deprecated Mods are on separate tabs at the bottom of the spreadsheet.

## FAQ

 I haven't played in a while and my mods aren't working. What do I do?
The best thing to do in this case is create a new Thunderstore profile and reinstall the Comfy Modpack and/or whichever mods you want from the approved mods list. Each new patch from the actual Valheim team will likely break some mods, so over time things sometimes stop working. Some mods become disallowed after a big patch (like Hearth and Home) because they break really badly. So make sure you're not using mods that are no longer allowed.

 Can I install mods with Nexus or manually?
You can install approved mods (See Mod List above) with whatever method you'd like. The modpack will save you time and keep you more up to date with the server though. Even if you don't use the Comfy Modpack I recommend using the Thunderstore Mod Manager in general as it is the easiest method and will send you mod updates automatically.

 How can I get help with a mod?
The easiest thing to do is post in 💬-general , there's a good chance someone has had your problem before.

 Am I allowed to change the config?
Yes, and in many cases it's necessary to do so. We recommend you do this in game by installing Configuration Manager and then pressing F1.

 What if I don't want every mod in the modpack?
Until Thunderstore rolls out their "optional dependencies" update (which is being worked on) the modpack is currently "all or nothing". (I know, it sucks in the meantime)
Optional Workarounds:
1.) You can go to Settings > Browse profile folder. Go into the Bepinex folder and then the plugins folder and manually delete the file. However new updates to the modpack will probably get it to download again. 
2.) OR you can go down the approved mods list above and install the ones you want  one at a time by searching for the name in Thunderstore. (Just make sure you install BepInEx as the first mod)
3.) OR install the modpack, then uninstall/disable the ones you don't want. This will disable the modpack itself so you won't get any new mods I add to the modpack-- but you'll at least have installed a bunch at a time to save you some work. You will still get updates to the individual mods--just not the modpack.

 How do I Install .dlls that aren't on Thunderstore?
Some mods are not on Thunderstore, they are only on Nexus. You can still get these mods (as long as they're on the approved mods list below).
1. Download the file from Nexus. Usually this is a zip folder with a .dll in it.
2. With your Thunderstore Comfy Valheim profile open, go to "Settings"
2. Click "Import local mod"
3. Select the zip folder
4. Usually you can just leave the settings like mod name as it is. Just click "import local mod"
5. Done! You'll now see this mod in your Thunderstore list. Please keep in mind that unlike mods installed from Thunderstore itself, these will not automatically update to newer versions. (edited)
